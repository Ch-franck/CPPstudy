## OJ Q&As

### How to test my program locally?

  1. First open cmd and change directory to your program output folder:

     `cd C:\XXX\C++\XXX\`

     > Notice: You should enter eg. `D:` to switch the drive if your file is in another drive

  2. Edit(Create) a input file, add test data
  
  3. Run in cmd: XXX.exe(Compiled executable binary) <in.txt> out.txt

     Example: `helloworld.exe <sampleinput.txt> sampleoutput.txt`
  
  4. Open the output file and check it

  This can detect many problems related to EOF detection, etc.

### Why I get Time Limit Exceeded?

  You might used a complicated method or more commonly, did not end your program normally. (eg. infinite loop; infinite detecting input)

### Why I get Wrong Answer?

  You might used a wrong method or you did not output your data properly. (You can use the method mentioned above to detect it!)

### Why I get Runtime Error?

  You might not considered that your program tried to get a non-exist array element. (eg. try to get the value of arr[-4], which is not defined)
